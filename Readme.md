This model should hold the basic properties of the information you are trying to capture.

- Add/Adjust Taghelpers/HTML/CSS to your site to make it more client ready.
- Add at least one Model named Register, with basic properties of what a student registration should consist of
- Use Scaffolding to generate the CRUD actions off of a "Register" Control. 
- Create an initial Migration
- Have a solid Home page for when users when they visit your site.
  - Include a link to the Register pages for a student to register
